## 🎓 Graduation Project — School of Solana Season 7

I’m excited to share that I’ve officially graduated from School of Solana – Season 7! 🚀 This program was a transformative journey where I deepened my Solana development skills, built real-world dApps, and collaborated with an amazing community of builders.

### 🌐 SalinaHive — Crowdfunding on Solana

SalinaHive is a non-custodial crowdfunding dApp on Solana. Creators can launch campaigns with a funding goal and deadline; supporters donate SOL trustlessly; and funds can be withdrawn by the campaign owner under defined conditions. The stack combines an Anchor program with a modern Next.js frontend.

### 🌟 Highlights from the Program

- **Advanced Solana dev**: Anchor, PDAs, CPI, SPL tokens
- **Hands-on builds**: real dApps, assignments, and cohort challenges
- **Production focus**: deployable programs and practical UX
- **Community**: learning, code reviews, and knowledge sharing

### 🧩 Key Features (SalinaHive)

- **Create campaigns**: title, description, image, goal (lamports), deadline
- **Donate SOL**: on-chain receipts for each donation
- **Withdrawals**: campaign owner withdrawal logic after conditions are met
- **Update/Delete**: maintain or remove campaigns as needed
- **Platform settings**: initialize and update global platform config

### 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **On-chain**: Rust, Anchor (PDAs, robust validation, custom errors)
- **Frontend**: Next.js + React + TypeScript, TailwindCSS
- **Client utils**: Anchor-generated IDL/types, Solana Web3 tooling

### 🔑 On-chain Program

- **Program ID**: `Fg852CkXa5T6tXeA86FCEj6zKa48U2oqMXMmPouvEWnP`
- **IDL**: `frontend/src/idl/salina_hive.json`
- **Generated types**: `frontend/src/idl/salina_hive.ts`

### 📁 Repo Layout

- `anchor_project/`: Anchor workspace — program, tests, and config
- `frontend/`: Next.js app — pages, components, providers, and client actions
